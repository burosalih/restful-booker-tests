## üîé Observations

- All CRUD operations functionally **work**, but **status codes and header handling** are inconsistent with RESTful best practices.
- The **token-based authentication** implementation is limited and could benefit from **support for Authorization headers**.

---

## üìã Recommendations

1. **Fix HTTP status codes** to align with REST conventions:
   - `201` ‚Üí `204` for DELETE
   - `201` ‚Üí `200` for `/ping`
   - `405` ‚Üí `404` for missing resources

2. **Support Bearer Token authentication** via `Authorization` header.
